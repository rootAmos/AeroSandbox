    "A couple interesting things to note, right off the bat!\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we chose to parameterize the wing sizing with the parameters of aspect ratio and wing area. The\n",
    "combination of these two variables uniquely determine the size and shape of our wing planform (recall that the wing\n",
    "is assumed to be rectangular).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, wing span and wing chord could also uniquely determine wing sizing. Why didn't we use those two as our\n",
    "variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, the truth is that we could, and we would have been totally fine. The aspect ratio - wing area\n",
    "parameterization is perhaps a hair nicer because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One of our parameters, aspect ratio, is a nondimensional parameter - this can help eliminate scaling issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We have some engineering intuition that quantities of interest, such as lift force and induced drag, are perhaps more directly connected in some sense to aspect ratio and wing area than chord and span.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, like I said, it really doesn't matter too much - just interesting observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "The second interesting thing is that we chose to log-transform these variables. This basically means that internally,\n",
    "the optimizer is really optimizing `log(wing area)` rather than the wing area itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "One implication of this is that wing area can never go negative (whereas if we had specified it as a normal\n",
    "optimization variable, nothing would prevent it from going negative unless we manually constrained it.) Of course,\n",
    "wing area should always be positive anyway, so this isn't a bad thing - in fact, it saves us one constraint. Just an\n",
    "important observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log-transforming has some pros and cons, although its usefulness can vary widely problem-to-problem. Some general\n",
    "notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A lot of engineering problems become convex or more-convex when log-transformed, which can lead to faster,\n",
    "more stable solutions and global optimality guarantees (although this requires one to first prove convexity,\n",
    "which isn't easily without something like Disciplined Convex Programming, which can be overly restrictive.) For more\n",
    "on this idea of log-transforming engineering problems, see work by former MIT Prof. Hoburg here:\n",
    "https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2015/EECS-2015-22.html .\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many scaling issues disappear under log-transformation, as many orders of magnitude can be spanned with relatively\n",
    "little change in the underlying log-transformed variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We more faithfully represent our design intent. If we think about how \"significant\" a design change is, we usually\n",
    "think multiplicatively, whether we realize it or not. A 10% drag decrease is roughly equally significant if our\n",
    "previous drag was 100 N as if it were 1e6 N. But if someone instead says \"We decreased drag by 1000 N\", your first\n",
    "question is probably \"Well what was it before?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* You get rid of one constraint for quantities that need to be positive, as you've transformed your constrained\n",
    "problem into an unconstrained one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Log-transformation is yet another nonlinearity, so it can make the problem more difficult to solve. This is a big\n",
    "one, especially on large (thousands of variables w/ nonlinear shenanigans) problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the optimal value of a variable goes to zero or negative, the log-transformed problem will a) not be correct and\n",
    "b) probably report that the problem is unbounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, I find that it's usually best to start without using log-transforms, and to add it in later if need be.\n",
    "We're using it in this example mostly just for illustration and to introduce the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue, and while we're at it, let's show how you can automatically bound a variable at initialization time."
